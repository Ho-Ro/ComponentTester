                  Change Log for the Component Tester firmware

                        (c) 2012-2013 by Markus Reschke

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.10m 2013-10
- Added support for external 2.5V voltage reference (hardware option).
- Added support for relay based cap discharging (hardware option).
- Changed good-bye message into welcome message to help to detect problems
  with the brown-out voltage of the MCU and to mitigate a voltage drop
  caused by an optional DC boost converter at startup.
- Added Zener tool (hardware option).
- The main menu got an exit function in case the menu was entered by mistake.
- Support of 16MHz MCU clock.

v1.09m 2013-07
- Added IGBT detection.
- Added a sanity check for MOSFETs.
- The hFE measurement for BJTs considers the leakage current in common emitter
  configuration.
- For MOSFETs the direction of the intrinsic diode is shown.
- Fixed problem with swapped drain and source pins for enhancement mode
  MOSFETs.
- Added workaround for Makefile problems with some IDEs. Some important Values
  can be defined in config.h too.

v1.08m 2013-07
- Since the SmallResistor() measurement can't give correct DC resistance
  values for some inductors a problem detection was added to CheckResistor()
  to keep the original high resistance measurement result.
- Added inductance measurement (ATmega328/P only)
- Minor improvements for the display of diodes and BJTs.
- Added leakage current measurement.
- Fixed problem with germanium BJTs with a high leakage current. They were
  detected as p-channel JFETs.
- Renamed some functions, clarified and added some remarks.

v1.07m 2013-06
- Optimized diode display function and added display of low current Vf.
- Improved the diode detection. Caps and resistors are excluded much better.
  Also the cap probing is skipped for diodes to speed up probing.  
- Fixed an array overflow bug in CheckResistor().
- Improved cursor display logic to tell user if another information follows
  or the probing loop is reentered.
- Improved UI of PWM tool to prevent exit by mistake (double key press
  required now).
- Added a generic menu function and adapted all menus (changed layout!).
- TestKey() provides a nice blinking cursor now.

v1.06m 2013-03
- Several minor improvements and cleanups.
- Expanded TestKey() to inform the user about an expected key press.  
- Improved TestKey() function to be more responsive for short key presses.
- Added a PWM tool to generate a PWM signal with different frequencies and
  duty ratios.
- Implemented a sleep function to reduce power usage of the tester.
  On average the power usage is nearly halfed (excluding the LCD backlight).
- Improved discharge function. If the discharge of a component fails, the
  concerned probe pin and the remaining voltage are displayed. That will help
  to detect a too low value for CAP_DISCHARGED.
- Added the capability to set error types

v1.05m 2012-11
- Moved LargeCap_table[] and SmallCap_table[] from EEPROM to flash to reduce
  EEPROM usage. The size for a German firmware exceeded the 512 bytes of an
  ATmega168s EEPROM.

v1.04m 2012-11
- Added a simple logic to the output function for diodes to prevent the
  measurement of capacitance for antiparallel diodes. 

v1.03m 2012-11
- Fixed detection problem of power diodes with high leakage current (mistaken
  for resistors).
- Fixed compiler warnings about possible uninitialized variables. That
  increased the firmware size by about 44 bytes :-(

v1.02m 2012-11
- Added upper limit for resistance of probe leads in the self adjustment
  function (1.00 Ohms).
- Selftest and adjustment functions perform a short circuit test before
  running the main part and return feedback now.
- The mainmenu gives feedback about success/failure of the selected action.

v1.01m 2012-10
- Added a checksum for adjustment values stored in the EEPROM and wrote a
  function to validate the checksum.
- Added a measurement function for small resistors (resolution: 0.01 Ohms).
- Extended self adjustment to support an auto-zero for the resistance of the
  probe leads.
- CheckResistor() runs an extra measurement for small resistors (<10 Ohms).
- Added a function to compare two scaled values. 
- Adapted several functions to support variable scaling of values.

v1.00m 2012-09
- Added a simple menu for selection of self test, self adjustment, update of
  the adjustment values in the EEPROM and display of values.
- Changed hfe from 16 bit to 32 bit value (no 65k limit anymore).

v0.99m 2012-09
- Initial public release based on Karl-Heinz' version 0.99k.
